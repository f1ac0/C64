# C64
I bought my fisrt C64. It was listed as "Untested", and off course it was faulty (12v fuse in PSU, 6569 VIC-II that I replaced with a 8565, and RAM U10 replaced with a 41256).

While repairing it, I learned about the components inside the C64, their signals and common faults. I bookmarked open-source alternatives and useful expansions : below is a list of the projects I found interesting.

In this repository I share the boards I created or modified for my own needs (while waiting for the replacement VIC-II). At the time of writing, they are still untested. 

# Disclaimer and Acknowledgements
This is a hobbyist project, it comes with no warranty and no support. Also remember that the Commodore machines are about 40 years old and may fail because of such hardware expansions.
